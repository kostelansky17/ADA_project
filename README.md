# Why do forests disappear?

## Abstract
Forests make life possible on earth. They provide vital services like CO2 absorption, watershed protection and prevention of soil erosion as well as being habitat for wildlife and guaranteeing livelihood for human. However, the forest covering percentage nowadays is sharply decreasing. According to [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14967), the global number of trees has fallen by 46% since the start of human civilization. Even worse, this summer thousands of fires have burned across most of the regions of Amazon rainforest, severely destroying the important carbon storehouse left on Earth. In addition, almost at the same time, huge wildfires broke out in Russiaâ€™s Siberian Province, bringing toxic thick smoke to the atmosphere. From these cases, deforestation has become one of the serious issues we human beings encounter.

In this project, our aim is to analyze the cause of deforestation based on our given dataset, trying to link it to the food production (grazing of livestock and farming), commodities manufacture by means of lumber and minerals extracted from the deforested areas. Moreover, we will investigate the deforestation rate during the last decade in different geographical regions, finding the trend in each country. Lastly, by our thorough analysis, we will try to put forth possible methods for alleviating deforestation.

## Research questions

- Why do forests disappear and what is the biggest cause of deforestation?
- Which country is the biggest exporter of wood?
- How can deforestation be limited?
- Is deforestation speed changing over a time or does this trend remain constant?
- Is there any country whose forests are expanding?

## Research goals

- Identify the trend of deforestation in the World
- Find the most deforested Countries/Areas
- Search for positive examples between counties in the terms of deforestation
- Investigate the deforestation in the most forested countries
- Find the biggest producers of wood and investigate the impact of wood mining on deforestation
- Look for the biggest Importers/Exporters (countries) in the world and the connections between them
- Search for correlations between agriculture industry/animal husbandry and deforestation
- ? Impact of growing cities on the forests and landscape
- ? Natural disasters (fires) in 2018 in the forests
- ? Emissions held in forests and their removal

## Dataset
We will mainly work with [Global Food & Agriculture Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics) dataset provided by FAO. Other datasources which could enrich our analysis will be taken into account eventually.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

### Week 1 (28.10. - 3.11.)

- Data collection from main dataset
  - Forest area [km2 or % of land area] by region and by year
  - Human activities (e.g. agriculture and land development) and natural disaster (e.g. wildfire) in the region in the year
- Looking for another data sources, if necessary
  - Complementary data sources to interpret causes of deforestation

### Week 2 (4.11. - 10.11.)

- Data exploration if necessary (cont.)
- Building main data frames
  - Clean datasets by interpolation, cleansing, and filtering
  - Merge datasets to main data frames

## Questions for TAs

- Do you know any ecological open data projects?
- Do you know where we could find satellite pictures of rainforests/woods (Amazon, Siberia, Congo) over time?
- Is our point of view compatible with the topic *Data Analysis for social good*?
