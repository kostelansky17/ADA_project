            <p class="text-black mb-0">
              Wood products are integral part of our daily lives.
              We have been using this material from beginning of our kind,
              but the demand has never been this big.
              The production of wood products, on average, has increased by two hundreds million m3
              in the past 20 years.
              And this trend doesn't seem to stop.
              The forests Co2 on our planet and with every sawn tree this number decreases.
              The production of wood-based panel has increased
              by alarming 160 percent from 1995.
              The growth is steady, only significant influence which was able the affect
              the wood production in the world was the economic crisis in 2007-2009.

            <p class="text-black mb-0">The leading continent in production primary forest products have been in Asia followed by Northern America nad Europe, but the impact of wood production on deforestation is clearest in South America and Africa. In these two continents has the production increased by almost 30 percent and the area of forested areas decreased by 7, respectively 6 percent. Let's take a closer look at countries which most to the production of roundwood.</p>

            <p class="text-black mb-0">
              World production of roundwood is occupied by limited countries and
              the top seven countries is resposible for more than a half of the production.
              In the list of top producers, we can find both top deforestated (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia) and reforestated (e.g. US, China) countries.
              Thus, the amount of forest products is correlated to shirinkage of forest areas in some regieon.
              It is, however, not the case everywhere in the world.
              Like US and India, there surely are countries that balance both wood production and reforestation out.

            <p class="text-black mb-0">All of therese countries lead in the production of roundwood in the world, but the effects of wood logging on the forested area are not so obvious as one could expect. All of the european nations (light blue) were able not to decrease share of the forested areas even trough the fact that this group of 6 countries (Russia, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, Poland) produces 13% of the world roundwood. Even in USA recorded increase, while being the world number one in 2015. The complete opposite trend can be observed in Africa (red) where in some of the countries, forested areas have decreased by more than 8% in last 20 years.</p>

              The value of primary forest products exceeded 150 billions of US$. This number is close to GDP of Czech republic in the very same year. Only Canada itself has exported to USA forest products worth 15 billions US$. There are dense connections between countries in the lumber market. The following figure show most important connections between countries. Many of them is on both sides of the market, either as an exporters (on the left) and importers (on the right).
