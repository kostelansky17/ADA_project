# Why forests disappear

## Abstract
Forests make life on earth possible. They provide vital services like CO2 absorption, watershed protection, and prevention of soil erosion as well as being habitat for thousands of life forms and livelihood for human.


Forests cover about 30% of the Earth total land area but this percentage is shrinking while the pace of deforestation is increasing. [An estimate of Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14967) says that the global number of trees has fallen by 46% since the start of human civilization, but the process is very heterogeneous both in time and space. In Latin America, for example, the reduction of forest areas mantains an ascending trend while Indonesia sees an encouraging drop in Primary Forest loss in 2017, [Global Forest Watch says](https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/2017-was-the-second-worst-year-on-record-for-tropical-tree-cover-loss). Our aim is to investigate the trend of deforestation during the last decades in different geographical regions, trying to link it to food production (grazing of livestock and farming) and, more in general, to commodities creation by means of lumber itself and minerals extracted from the deforested areas. Recent massive wildfires in the Amazon and Siberia areas contributed to create awareness of the problem and added an (also) natural component to the aforementioned anthropic causes, linking the topic to the much discussed issue of climate change. 

- the trees and their role in the global warmig / ecology?ak.a. why wy have selected it? why it's happening?
- the trend over recent years - some data
- the natural disaster over last year - fires etc.
- exploring the trend? time and space? some contries exmaples maybe?
- why have we selected this topic? - Why are forest disappearing?
- our aproach

## Research questions
- Why forests disapper and what's the biggest cause of deforestation?
- Which countries are biggest exporters of wood?
- How can I influence the deforestation in a positive way?
- It deforestation speed changing over a time, and is this trend sustainable?
- Is there a country in the world where are forrests expanding?

## Dataset
We will mainly work with [Global Food & Agriculture Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics) dataset provided by FAO. Other datasources which could enrich our analysis will be taken into account eventually.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
### Week 1 (28.10. - 3.11.)
- Data collection and cleaning
### Week 2 (4.11. - 10.11.)
- Local data analysis
### Week 3 (11.11. - 17.11.)
- Map reduce jobs
- Collection of results
### Week 4 (18.10. - 24.11.)
- Analysis of results
- Discusion about the results


## Questions for TAa
- Do you know any ecological open data projects?
- Do you know where could we find satellite pictures of rainforests/woods (Amazon, Siberia, Congo)?
- It is our point of view compatible with the topic *Data Analysis for social good*?
